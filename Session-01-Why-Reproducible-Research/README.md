# GEOG 712 Reproducible Research

## Session 1. Agenda/Notes

### Round table introductions

### Motivation

### Why Reproducible Research: Benefits and costs

#### What advantages, personally, do you see in terms of reproducible research?

#### What costs?

The majority of the cost of Reproducible Research are associated with time:

1. Planning – Understand where you want to end up and plot a course to get there. 

2.	Developing standards 

   +	File Naming
   +	Identifying storage/back-up processes
   +	Determining appropriate tools to use
   +	Identifying proper infrastructure
   +	Creating process flow
  
3.	Learning the tools

   + Installing the tools
   + Learning how to use them
   + Becoming comfortable with various tools
   + Writing the documentation:  Writing documentation takes time. It takes time and discipline to slow yourself down to document your work. 
   
### Policy environment

1.	Social and science policy

2.	[Funding Organizations](https://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_547652FB.html)

3.	[Journals](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2584)

### The what of reproducible research

[What are the components of reproducible research?](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2584#T2)

### The how of reproducible research

1.	Roadmap for the course

2.	Organization of course

  + Technical needs
  + Base knowledge
  + Data
  + Style of the course: mix of hands-on practices and information sessions

3.	Assessment
  + Cumulative exercises and practices
  + Progressive grading scheme

4.	End product

  + An example of a reproducible research [project.](https://github.com/paezha/Reproductive-Rate-and-Density-US-Reanalyzed)

  + An example of an open [paper.](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/integrating-gat#abstract)
  
  + An [Open Data Product.](https://soukhova.github.io/TTS2016R/)
